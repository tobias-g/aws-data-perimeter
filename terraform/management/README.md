# Management AWS Account

The Terraform in this folder is an example of what is deployed to the management
account to setup a AWS data perimeter.

It is to go in tandem with the sandbox and prod deployment with examples of
poorly configured S3 buckets to show how we can deploy policies to protect them
(and other buckets) using SCPs and compliance monitoring.
